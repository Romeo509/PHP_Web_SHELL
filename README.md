# PHP_Web_SHELL🐘💻🔒

<h3>PHP Web Shell</h3>
<h4>Overview🔍</h4>

This PHP Web Shell is a powerful and versatile tool designed for file system operations directly from a web interface. It includes a wide range of commands such as ls, pwd, cd, touch, rm, mkdir, rmdir, download, and upload, providing a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing files and directories. <br>
<h3>Capabilities💡</h3>
The web shell does not provide direct access to the server shell (e.g., bash, sh). Instead, it executes predefined PHP functions to manage file system operations.

<h3>Bypassed Restrictions🔓:</h3>
1. <b>Server-Side Command Execution Restrictions:-</b> The web shell executes commands through PHP, potentially bypassing direct command execution restrictions imposed by server configurations. <br>
2. <b>Web Server Security Measures:-</b> Manages directory changes, file operations, and uploads internally within PHP, which might bypass typical web server protections. <br>
3. <b>Access Control and Permissions:-</b> Operates under the web server user permissions, which can differ from standard user permissions, allowing for broader access in some cases. <br>

<h3>Features✨</h3>
Command Execution: Supports a wide range of commands for file and directory operations.
File Upload and Download: Securely upload and download files through the web interface.
Session Management: Keeps track of the current directory using session management.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a sidebar with available commands and documentation, enhancing usability.
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation directly within the interface to guide users.
